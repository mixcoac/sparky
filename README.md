Sparky is a colour palette/theme inspired by Enter Shikari's [The Spark](https://album.link/mx/i/1263896001), made with accessibility and PMS compliance in mind. It features range of 18 colours, and resembles other palettes like Solarized or Nord.

Its palette was swatched from Enter Shikari album covers (TS and NiR&EiP), completed using a harmonic colour wheel, adjusted for colour balance, contrast and accessibility for colourblind users, and then matched to their closest Pantone equivalents.

## Palette
Sparky has in total 18 colours, 8 "main", 8 "bright" and 2 for the foreground and background.

## Install
Sparky was planned as only a colour palette to build themes from, so by itself there isn't a set "official" Sparky theme for anything.

However, there's some methods to get a Sparky theme running on your machine.

### Terminals
Using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy), configurations for Sparky are available for many terminal emulators.  You can find some config files in `src` and instructions on how to install them in your terminal [here](src/README.md).

[Sparky is currently in the process of being added to Gogh](https://github.com/Gogh-Co/Gogh/pull/423).

### Base16
Using Base16 builders/manager, you can load Sparky using [`sparky.yml`](src/sparky.yml).

This allows you to import Sparky to basically anything with a Base16 builder/manager like [Flavours](https://github.com/misterio77/flavours) or [Themix](https://github.com/themix-project/themix-gui).

### Community-sourced Themes
You can find Sparky community themes searching for [#sparky-theme](https://github.com/search?q=sparky-theme) in Github.
