# Sparky
![Image of two Black Box terminals using Sparky, displaying the commands pfetch and colours each as a demonstration. Font used is Intel One Mono, and a custom edit of The Spark's album cover is used as the wallpaper.](ast/sc.png)

Sparky is a colour palette/theme inspired by Enter Shikari's [The Spark](https://album.link/mx/i/1263896001) made with aesthetics and PMS compliance in mind. It features a range of 28 colours, and resembles palettes like Solarized or Nord.

Its palette was swatched from Enter Shikari album covers (TS and NiR&EiP), completed using a harmonic colour wheel, adjusted for contrast balance; and accessibility for colourblind users, and then matched to their closest Pantone equivalents.

## Palette
Sparky has in total 28 colours, 8 "main", 8 "bright", 5 "background", 5 "foreground" and 2 blacks.

### Accessibility
Sparky was originally designed with accessibility in mind, prioritising colourblind distinctions and contrast balancing, and attempting to reduce eye sore. As Sparky's palette grew from 10 colours to 16, 18, 24, and now 36 colours; this became a harder task to balance out.

Sparky's entire palette is not colourblind safe, only its "main" variant, and its background/extra colours have been tested to be colourblind safe. Sparky still tries its best at being colourblind safe, with fairly noticeable contrast between all variants, but it might be difficult to tell colours apart for some users with more extreme cases of colourblindness.

Sparky is designed to be as readable and usable as possible in all kind of scenarios, making contrast a priority, and attempts to have all of its colours fit within AA (4.5:1) level under WCAG guidelines when compared against its background colour.

Sparky averages a [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) contrast rating of 7.5:1 (AAA).

## Install
Sparky was planned as only a colour palette to build themes from, so there aren't any "official" Sparky themes.

However, Sparky themes are available in a few odd ways, mainly for terminals.

### Terminals

#### Gogh (recommended)
[Gogh](https://gogh-co.github.io/Gogh/) is a repository of themes that can be installed running a single command and picking a theme. You can find Sparky there.

```
bash -c  "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"
```

#### terminal.sexy/manual
Using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy), configurations for Sparky are available for many terminal emulators. You can also fine tune and customise Sparky's colours to your liking by importing [`sparky.xresources`](src/sparky.xresources) into terminal.sexy.

You can find some exported/generated config files on `src` and instructions on how to install them in your terminal [here](src/INSTALL.md).

### Base16 and Base24
Sparky is available as a Base16 and as a Base24 scheme; refer to [`sparky16.yml`](src/sparky16.yml) for Base16, or [`sparky24.yml`](src/sparky24.yml) for Base24.

This allows you to import Sparky into basically anything with a Base16/24 builder/manager like [Tinty](https://github.com/tinted-theming/tinty) or [Themix (Base16 only)](https://github.com/themix-project/themix-gui).

Note that due to Base16 only using 16 colours (who would've guessed) and due to its format, bright variants of colours and darks were removed.

### Community-sourced Themes
You can find Sparky community themes searching for [#sparky-theme](https://github.com/search?q=sparky-theme) in Github.

Currently there are none but one can have dreams.

## Credits
This theme was possible thanks to the following tools and people:
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) - used for its colour wheel and colourblind safety checks
- [Eric's Color Blender](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/color-blend/) - used alongside AC's colour wheel to find colours
- [iColorpalette](https://icolorpalette.com) - used for converting HEX codes for Pantone and finding alternative shades
- [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) - used for live-testing, and exporting configs found in `src`
- [Enter Shikari Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yuPuTsQARE) - for encouraging me to continue developing the scheme
- [@tinted-theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming) - for hosting info, schemes and tools for B16/24
- [@maisymoe](https://github.com/maisymoe) - for getting me into Enter Shikari, and saving my life
