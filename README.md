Sparky is a colour palette/theme inspired by Enter Shikari's [The Spark](https://album.link/mx/i/1263896001). Its palette was swatched from Enter Shikari album covers (TS and NiR&EiP), adjusted for colour balance and distinction for colourblind users, and adjusted to follow Pantone colour sets -- just like Enter Shikari brand colours are.

## Installing
Currently, Sparky is only available for many terminal emulators, you can find instructions on how to install Sparky in your terminal [here](src/README.md). 

There are plans to add Sparky to Gogh.

## Contributing
This repository only accepts contributions for Sparky in terminal emulators as it serves as a meta repo for examples.

Feel free to create your own Sparky theme for your favourite app, and host it in your own personal repo.

## License
Sparky is released under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org) license, this means that Sparky is released under the public domain, and you can do literally anything you want with the files provided here and the colour scheme swatched by me.

Reasoning for this is that copyrighting a set of colours is, to say the very least, fucking retarded[¹](https://draculatheme.com/pro)[²](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_trade_mark).
